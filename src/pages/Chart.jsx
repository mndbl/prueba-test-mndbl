              <p>
                A staff manager oversees a team of employees. Staff managers
                work in every industry, with duties varying greatly by each
                individual company. Some work in marketing, some in sales, some
                in advertising, others in construction or insurance. But
                regardless of field, staff managers share a common goal: to keep
                their employees motivated and working as team. Staff managers in
                every industry handle many of the same tasks. That includes
                interviewing and hiring employees and making certain they are
                properly trained. Staff managers also conduct performance
                reviews, and if necessary, fire employees. But that is often a
                last resort, as staff managers aim to keep morale and production
                high, limiting discord and turnover. They also handle scheduling
                their staff, assigning accounts and duties, and identifying
                problems and finding ways to overcome them.
