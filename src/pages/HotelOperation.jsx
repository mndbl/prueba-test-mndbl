          <SubTitle>Reservation procedures:</SubTitle>
          <ParagraphSm>
            The procedure of reservation are filling all the necessary
            information on top. Determining the availability of rooms is the
            process in which we test the guest demand written during the first
            phase. One should verify the availability by referring to the
            forecast map, traditional map or density chart. Through computerized
            systems or software, which is more effective, we can start checking
            in the same availability in a fully automated system.
          </ParagraphSm>
          <SubTitle>Except or deny application:</SubTitle>
          <ParagraphSm>
            Now we can anticipate or reject the booking request after checking
            the room availability in the hotel. Expecting can be achieved if the
            request is completely checked by the available formats and
            framework, where it can be performed for denying and vice versa.{" "}

          <SubTitle>Documenting the details of bookings: </SubTitle>
          <ParagraphSm>
            The next process is documentation, after accepting or denying the
            reservation. Documentation is achieved by booking staff by
            completing an unfinished section of the booking form with the
            requisite information of the guest who is about to stay.{" "}
          </ParagraphSm>
          <SubTitle> Confirmation of booking request: </SubTitle>
          <ParagraphSm>
            Usually, after documenting a guest's details, we need to confirm the
            room to a guest by sending a confirmation letter to the guest with a
            guaranteed reservation and may sometimes also be non-guarantee.

          <SubTitle> Maintain record of bookings:</SubTitle>
          <ParagraphSm>
            {" "}
            We need to make a reservation record for and and every booking we
            make after confirming a room to the guest. The documents can be
            stored or handled in two ways. By recording the original
            reservation, where one will register and record the original
            reservation information in this process and we will submit a written
            reservation form if we operate in a computerized system, the
            documentation is done on a basis of date of arrival and afterward in
            assurance to the surname of the guest. Another way is by
            modification of reservation, and the next step in processing is to
            change the details recorded in the booking form. In this case, we
            must attach the various forms of evaluation / correction or slip
            with the original one. And last but not least, compilation of a
            booking report, now we need to prepare the reservation report for
            any day, week, month or year after completion of the reservation
            recorddivide-y-2.

            sat the gift shop) paid for by the individual rather than a
            corporation, and the like. The cashier must inquire if late charges

            any last - minute phone calls were made.

            received, laundry that was not sent out, or in - room movies that
