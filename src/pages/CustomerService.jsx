                    There are basic points the Stronger staff  will be aware to provide excellent customer service:
                    <ul className="ml-4">
                        <li>
                            Solve the problem when it occurs. It's always best when people on the floor or in the field are the first line of response.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Don't greet agitation with agitation.

                        </li>
                        <li>

                            It is helpful to think of resolving a dispute as a five-step process called the Five A's: Acknowledge the problem. Apologize, even if you think you're right. Accept responsibility. Adjust the situation with a negotiation to fix the problem. Assure the customer that you will follow through.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Don't forget salesmanship. The skills and techniques of good selling discussed earlier are even more valuable in difficult situations. Address customers by name, and repeat what they've said.

                        </li>

                    </ul>
